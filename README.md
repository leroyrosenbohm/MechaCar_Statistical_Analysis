## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

1. The three variables are the intercept itself(mpg), vehicle length and ground clearance.
2. The slope is not zero. The p-value is less than 0.05.
3. Yes it is effective, being accurate ~70% of the time.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

1. Lots 1 and 2 are within spec while lot 3 exceeds. 

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

On Lot 1 and Lot 3 the PSI values are not different from the population mean. Lot 2 there is evidence that the suspension coil is different from the population mean. 

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

Horsepower, 0-60 times, and safety scores are 3 factors that go into consumer decision making. We can use the same, but slightly alterted tests when comparing to the competition. We can make a null hypothesis stating that it is not different from the competition and our Alternative would be the opposite. We would need to use the t-test after collecting the data.
